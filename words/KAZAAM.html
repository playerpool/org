        <p>When the Player Pool webmaster and reigning champion told me he was skeptical of the Spreadsheet’s predictive prowess and said a new system was needed, I was skeptical. After all, pythagorean expectations are a proven commodity in the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_W6j9mWOr_8/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">NerdSquad</a> community.</p>
        
        <p>Player Pool pre-tournament predictions date back to 2016, when The Equation* was derived. Beginning in 2017, predictions prior to tipoff were recorded for posterity, allowing for efficacy comparisons between predictions based on the selection committee and NerdSquad rating systems. In the chart below, I’ve plotted the predicted point totals for the tournament seed (black) or pythagorean (blue) ratings against the actual Player Pool results.</p>

        <p>As can be seen from these scatter clouds, the performance of both systems thus far (‘17-21) has been downright terrible. In fact, neither has provided a statistically significant predictive value. How about their ability to predict the order of the final standings?</p>
        <img src="images/Kazaam2.png" alt="More data cloud" style="width:512px;height:372px;">
        
        <p>Again, both approaches have performed poorly. Can they at least predict the eventual champion? The seeding-based prediction has identified the eventual winner once in four years (Farach in 2018), which is no different, statistically-speaking, than random guessing. The pythagorean system has fared better, correctly identifying the Player Pool champion twice in four years, a significant improvement over guessing (p=0.015).</p>
        
        <p>Dear readers, shouldn’t we expect more from the Spreadsheet? Is the NerdSquad really the pinnacle of Player Pool prognostication?</p>
        
        <p>To find out, I’ve scrapped the <i>maths</i> (British for ‘math’) and turned instead to Biology 101, i.e. neural networks. Gentleman, I give you the K.A.Z.A.A.M - (kernel-actuated) zahm algorithmic assessment machine. The K.A.Z.A.A.M has been trained on 12 years of Spreadsheet data, everything from draft position to homecourt longitude. Subsequently, our machine was fed this year’s squads and predicted the following Player Pool standings for 2022:</p>
