            <h3>by The Comptroller</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>It was unseasonably cold in the April of 2006. Even for a part of the
            country known for its harsh and lengthy winters, the residents of Ann
            Arbor, Michigan found themselves in a dark state of mind. The previous
            fall, the University of Michigan football team had suffered through
            its worst season in over thirty years. In early March, the Michigan
            basketball team missed the NCAA tournament for a record fourteenth
            year in a row. Scandal racked the University's bastion of academia
            when an English professor was caught fornicating with an under age
            student in a library bathroom stall. Then, to add insult to injury, on
            the 17th of April a vicious storm swept over the Great Lakes and
            charted a path of destruction across southern Michigan with Ann Arbor
            as its most enticing target.</p>
            <p>Sitting on a ripped, smelly sofa in his college house on that day, a
            twenty-two year old pre-med student found himself equally despondent
            -- though for different reasons. After seven years of participating in
            Player Pools (his first was in 1999 when he had to watch his close
            friend celebrate Wally Szczerbiak's then record 43 points in the first
            round), he had come as close as ever to his first title. With a team
            led by future NBA players Jordan Farmar (UCLA), Aaron Afflalo (UCLA)
            and Brandon Roy (University of Washington) he could feel the
            transcendant victory in his grasp... only to watch it all disappear.
            On March 27th, before 73k fans in the National Title game in
            Indianapolis, a then little known and odd-appearing big named Joakim
            Noah scored sixteen points and his unheralded white teammate Lee
            Humphrey poured in fifteen leading his roommate's team to the win.
            Florida won its first national title ever and this young man's heart
            was broken.</p>
            <p>The only thing he found himself looking forward to was the coming
            spring and a scheduled trip to Philadelphia to visit a medical school
            to which he had been accepted. Jefferson Medical College was perhaps a
            strange choice of a school for him to attend. After all, he had also
            been accepted into medical school just a few blocks from his home at
            the Ohio State University. There he could enjoy not only the benefits
            of a cheaper tuition but the comforts of home. Many thought the
            decision was obvious and easy. "Jefferson?" the skeptics said. "What's
            that? I've never even heard of it." But something in his heart told
            him he should give Philadelphia one last look. So on April 17th he
            drove his Honda Civic through gray skies and blustery winds to the
            Detroit Airport, bound for the Jefferson "second look".</p>
            <p>I've spent many days and nights contemplating how the course of my
            life may have changed if that great winter storm hadn't suddenly and
            unexpectedly changed course. Twice that fateful night I was told my
            flight was canceled. More times than I can count I was assured it was
            going to be delayed. But in the end, neither happened and I arrived in
            Philadelphia to clear skies, warm weather and kegs of Yuengling in
            Jeff Hall.</p>
            <p>I could, if I so choose, speak of how I met my future wife on this day.
            But I choose instead to focus on another encounter that would change
            my life. For it was on that night that I first met a sandy-haired,
            under-sized, ferocious rebounding North Carolinian named Rob Kinner.
            Kinner instantly established himself as a leader that night, rallying
            the shy men and women to go out to Moriarty's for drinks. I remember
            only so much about that night. I know we had fun. I know we sat at a
            round table near the front window. I know we went somewhere after. But
            we didn't talk college hoops that night. I don't believe I mentioned
            my near loss in my 2006 Player Pool (although it's very possible I
            would have brought it up). We certainly didn't know that the Sweepers
            Dynasty was only months away from formation. I don't think I met
            anyone else in this chain that night. And I definitely didn't think
            that Alexia would ever want to talk to me again.</p>
            <p>But something in my heart told me that Jefferson was where I was
            supposed to be. I signed my letter of intent the following day. I
            tried to get it televised on ESPNNEWS with a series of hats to choose
            from but they turned me down.</p>
            <p>So much has happened in the ten years since then that it's difficult
            to write it all out. Engagements. Marriages. Children. New jobs. A
            diaspora of Sweepers greatness and Player Pool excellence across this
            great country of ours. But through all of this, the one constant in
            our lives has been the Player Pool. Come March every year we know that
            we can count on Josh's trash talking emails, Adam's ever-evolving
            excel sheets, heart breaking early round losses, unforeseen trips to
            the Final Four, buzzer beaters, and player illness or other
            misfortunes. Will anyone ever forget Bryan drafting three Texas A&M
            players only to find out that one got so nervous before games he
            routinely had to be subbed out to throw up on the sideline? Or when we
            all missed the boat on Stephan Curry (Davidson)? Or when the
            Comptroller was thrilled about his draft -- only to then lose two
            players before the first round because of new onset type one diabetes
            and pneumonia?</p>
            <p>These events -- and so many more like them -- have become the fabric
            of our lives. As much a part of who we are as the houses in which we
            grew up, the local pool where we spent our summer days, the bars where
            we spent the nights of our wayward early 20's. But as much joy, as
            much exhilaration, as much meaning as the Player Pool has given all of
            us, we all know that in return the Player Pool has been the most
            fickle of mistresses. Like the moon waxing and waning in the night
            sky, the fate of our teams each year constantly changes. One moment we
            feel as if we are going to get six of our players into the Final Four.
            The next, not only is your big man on the bench for the rest of the
            first half because he picked up his third foul, but your other teams
            are losing too and you'll be lucky if you even get one player to
            advance.</p>
            <p>The names of past champions are well known to us but worth repeating.</p>
            <p>Alex (2007) -- Like a brash, cocky freshman appearing in the Final
            Four, Alex showed no nerves in compiling a record 488 points (still
            stands) in the inaugural pool. Maybe now he understands what a big
            deal it was. He is title-less since that time and rumors of self-doubt
            have plagued him all offseason.</p>
            <p>Farach (2008) -- Like Alex, he has yet to repeat his magic and capture
            his second ring. Will having two children be the spark he needs?</p>
            <p>Bryan (2009) -- After a solid first two years, the former All-American lineman at Carnegie Mellon captured his first of two titles.</p>
            <p>Josh (2010) -- Not part of the inaugural pool in 2007, Josh used the
            chip on his shoulder to drive himself to the title.</p>
            <p>Rob (2011) -- Was living with Alex the reason he sucked the first four
            years? And then won as soon as they moved out? Rob had to be wondering
            that after capturing the first post-med school title. His stats since
            then, however, don't bear that theory out...</p>
            <p>Bryan (2012) -- Bryan's second title. Has he grown complacent since
            then? Self-satisfied? Lazy and unfocused? That's certainly what his
            critics are saying, especially after scheduling international trips
            during two consecutive tournaments.</p>
            <p>Josh (2013) -- oh fucking shit, I forgot he won a second.</p>
            <p>Comptroller (2014) -- First of two.</p>
            <p>Comptroller (2015) -- Second of two.</p>
            <p>You know if your name is not listed above.</p>
            <p>You don't need me to rub it in.</p>
            <p>You don't need me to remind you.</p>
            <p>But I'm going to anyway.</p>
            <p>JAMES and ADAM</p>
            <p>Is this the year they get off the schnide? Or will the Comptroller
            roll to his record breaking third title in a row? A lot is at stake
            this year in the 10th Anniversary Player Pool. Let's start talking
            about basketball...</p>
            <p>College hoops took a beating in the press this year. After the
            2014-2015 season was headlined by such great stories and teams as
            Kentucky's quest for an undefeated season, the brilliance of Wisconsin
            big man Frank Kaminsky, and Duke's rising star freshmen, the 2015-2016
            season was a let down for everyone. The country's best player (Ben
            Simmons, LSU) and future #1 pick, was stuck on an absolutely horrible
            team that never really had a chance at making the tournament. Other
            top stars failed to live up to the hype. Jamal Murray on Kentucky is
            obviously good but hardly worth planning your night around. Skal
            Labissiere on Kentucky is so rail thin he makes James look Jesse. And
            Brandon Ingram on Duke has rebounded to play very well... but he got
            off to such a bad start that he was never big star material. Now, yes,
            there was Buddy Hield (Oklahoma) who shot lights out all year and
            averaged a crazy 25 points a game (has anyone in our draft ever had a
            higher regular season scoring average?) but his team bounced around
            all year. And one of the country's best players (Kris Dunn,
            Providence) was hardly ever on national TV. I can't spit out the facts
            and stats but an extremely high number of teams were ranked #1 this
            year... and then lost... and then got back there... and then lost
            again. There were no GREAT teams this year and the general consensus
            is that that means it's going to be a crazy tournament. We'll see.
            Sometimes the craziest things come when you least expect it. Maybe
            this will be the year all top seeds advance.</p>
            <p>Regardless of that, this has huge implications for the Player Pool.
            There are very few big names. Everyone has question marks. Draft order
            was probably entirely irrelevant. As always it's going to come down to
            who can get points out of their bottom picks and who can get players
            into the Final Four. I'll look at each of the teams in draft order.</p>
            <p>The Comptroller -- Well spread across all four regions, I decided to
            disperse my picks as much as possible this year, betting on massive
            attrition of top seeds losing and just hoping the teams I picked get
            through. Since I'm so spread out (no two players on same team) I'll be
            hard to eliminate... but it will also be hard for me to win.</p>
            <p>Amsterdam -- Bryan has big upside with Buddy Hield. If Oklahoma
            advances, I'm going to look like the guy who drafted Stephon Marbury
            over Kobe Bryant. Brandon Ingram (Duke, likely #2 pick in draft this
            year) in the fifth round could also be huge. We all know that NBA
            talent tends to win out in the tourney. AJ Hammons (Purdue) and Kyle
            Wiltjer (Gonzaga) are high risk, high reward picks. Hammons is the
            type of guy who can pick up fouls in a heart beat. And Wiltjer can
            score as well as anyone (20.7 per game) but Gonzaga has been plagued
            by poor guard play this year. But Purdue can definitely make a run.
            They are huge in the paint, something very few teams can say.</p>
            <p>Rob -- Rob simultaneously had one of my favorite picks... and one of
            my least favorite. Taking Marcus Paige ahead of Justin Jackson and
            Joel Barry II demonstrated a savvy understanding of the importance of
            great guard play in the tourney. Paige has never quite lived up to his
            considerable hype but he's the kind of guy that will constantly have
            the ball in his hands. But taking a Virginia player with the first
            pick? Call me a skeptic until proven otherwise. Tony Bennett's teams
            slow shit down, play incredible defense and don't score very much...
            and they score even less in the tournament. Even if they advance I
            wonder if they will score enough to justify a first round selection.
            Rob will also have to see if he can overcome the adversity of
            selecting a player who then is injured hours later... in practice.
            Gotta wonder what that does to a team's psyche.</p>
            <p>Alex -- I'm going to echo my UVA concerns here as well (Anthony Gill
            and London Perrantes -- great names by the way). But how great is that
            Yogi Ferrell pick in the sixth round? He's a baller and can get so hot
            when he's on. I'm intrigued by A-Rod on Miami as well. Miami is set to
            face Nova in the Sweet Sixteen if both advance. That game will have
            big implications for Alex's Nova-less squad.</p>
            <p>Josh -- The general public's skepticism of Oregon as a worthy #1 seed
            trickled down into the Player Pool as the Canadian guard Dillon Brooks
            (17 per game) fell to the fifth pick. I like this pick for Josh
            because this should make Brooks come into the tourney with a chip on
            his shoulder, ready to prove he belongs, just as Josh did winning his
            first title. With two role players on Michigan State (Matt Costello
            and Eron Harris), Josh will need more than just MSU to make the Final
            Four as others will have their best scorers.</p>
            <p>Farach -- With Tyler Ulis (Kentucky), Melo Trimble (Maryland), Joel
            Berry II (UNC) and Gabe York (Arizona), Farach cornered the market on
            scoring point guards. I personally love this strategy. They have the
            ball all the time. They don't get into foul trouble. And college hoops
            is a guard's game. But only one of these guys (Berry) is on a high
            seed so Farach is going to need those lower seeds to advance.</p>
            <p>Adam -- I feel like Adam has the most firepower in his top two picks.
            Both Jamal Murray (Kentucky) and Grayson Allen (Duke) have the ability
            to score 25 plus. And we all know that Kentucky seems to advance every
            year. I also love the Devonte Graham pick. I'm pretty sure that guy
            scored a ton in big conference tourney games, a sign that in crunch
            time he's going to be getting the ball a lot. He didn't just get his
            ppg up against cupcakes in November.</p>
            <p>James -- oh man, Oklahoma and Villanova. That's what it comes down to.
            Everyone else really spread their picks this year but James is all in
            with these two. As James voiced to me in an email, was it wise to pick
            three players on Oklahoma who barely add up to how much Buddy Hield
            scores? I argued back that likely Hield won't score THAT much in the
            tourney and if they do advance then James's three players will be a
            big reason why. But that theory goes out the window if they are upset
            early. Bryn Forbes on Michigan State seems like a great pick to me.
            That guy can get so hot (sorry for my continued big ten bias by the
            way in who I point out).</p>
            <p>That's how I see things. As always, I don't know who is going to win.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I want to take the end of this email first to say thank you for
            reading this far... unless you skimmed down to the end (I wouldn't
            blame you). I also want to extend my thanks for a great draft process.
            As I alluded to in another email I took part in a "live" draft on
            Sunday night over g chat and it was terrible. Everyone was rushing.
            Everyone wanted to be done. Picks were rushed. Pressure was applied.
            Too many players (10 per team instead of eight and ten pool
            participants). Some weird rules about drafting people in play-in game.
            No one left satisfied. The simplicity and straight forward-ness of our
            system is crucial. And it is you fine gentlemen, athletes, scholars
            and warriors that make it great. Perhaps one day we will be lucky
            enough to find our children and our children's children pouring
            through these emails and spread sheets, gazing in wide eyed wonder at
            what we have created. Or perhaps they will just wonder how possibly we
            could have spent this much time on something like this. We may never
            be able to explain it. They may never understand. But I say to them:
            You. Go. Find seven of your closest friends. Bring them together.
            Start your own Player Pool. Suffer through years of disappointment and
            heart break, working and striving for a championship that may never
            come your way. And then perhaps someday you will understand the legacy
            we pass forward to you via sweat, blood and tears through the
            generations.</p>
            <p>UNC-Wilmington tips off against Duke in just half an hour.</p>
            <p>James and Adam, let's hope this is your year. March Madness always does love an underdog.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,<br>The Comptroller</p></div>
