            <h1>2014 Player Pool Preview</h1>
            <h4>by Comptroller</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Less than four hours to tip, let's take a look at everyone's teams...</p>
            <p>First off, is it just me or is this year's player pool really lacking in star power in comparison to previous years? It just seems like all the star players are on teams that are entering the tournament with weaknesses.</p>
            <p>Jabari Parker on Duke as a 3 seed with eight losses and no inside presence.</p>
            <p>Wiggins on Kansas with a lot of youth and Embiid likely out for tourney.</p>
            <p>Julius Randle on 8 seed Kentucky (I'm still pissed at Rob for stealing him from me in the last round of the draft).</p>
            <p>Russ Smith (last year's tourney leading scorer) on 4 seed Louisville and in the "toughest" region.</p>
            <p>Doug McDermott on Creighton.</p>
            <p>Maybe this is hindsight being 20/20 but I feel like in previous years the big one and two seeds had more star power. I think all of this could make for a crazy year in the player pool.</p>
            <p>Here's a quick run down as I see it...</p>
            <h3>FARACH</h3>
            <p>As we well know picking first overall is a double edged sword, especially in this year with no clear top player on a top team. McDermott is a gamble and he'll need to pay off. After that it's all about Iowa State and UCLA for Farach. DeAndre Kane and Georges Niang (I had never heard of either of these guys and Michigan even played them this year) need to go off. And Kyle Anderson and Jordan Adams need to do the same for UCLA. ISU is in the "weakest" region for what that's worth (sorry, Alex). But UCLA is going to need to get past Florida, I'm guessing for Farach to have his best shot.</p>
            <h3>COMPTROLLER</h3>
            <p>I'm skeptical about my team as always. I'm riding the Sparty bandwagon with Adreian Payne and Brandon Dawson, both of whom had injury problems during the season and here's hoping they don't come back. I tried to spread my people out as much as possible with the hopes of having multiple people in Final Four. On the plus side, I'm not banking on any one team or region to carry me. On the negative side, I've never won this fucking league before so I'm sure something will go wrong.</p>
            <h3>BRYAN</h3>
            <p>I respect the Cleanthony Early first round pick even though I'm skeptical of it. The rest of this roster just doesn't strike me as impressive but who am I to say? Ron Baker and Joe Harris back to back strikes me as the kind of bold, innovative move that could pay off if this becomes the tournament of Whitey. I can't even analyze the rest of this roster. LaQuinton Ross can get damn hot when he's on but they face the 'Cuse zone in round two if they can beat Dayton.</p>
            <h3>ROB</h3>
            <p>I love Rob's team. You got Wiggins up top who has been scoring likely crazy of late. Plus his team is missing a key player so he will need to score even more. Even if they go out in round 2 I could still see him putting up 60 points. Ejim scored over 40 in a game for ISU this year so you know he can fill it when necessary. Frank Kaminski is indeed a very white name for a very white player but he's also seven foot and can shoot the three ball. Rodney Hood is a baller on Duke who can get hot and ride Parker's coat tails (if he doesn't throw up too much). And Julius Randle in the last round? Hmmm mmmm mmm I love that pick. I also love Calipari (I'm probably the only person in the country who loves both college basketball and him I realize.</p>
            <h3>JAMES</h3>
            <p>James is giving me much less to write about this year. The Gators are key for him (Patric Young and Casey Prather). Prather just sounds to me like the name of someone who will flop in the tourney by the way. Also the incredibly dynamic and athletic Wisconsin back court picks of Ben Brust and Traevon Jackson. Whoever thought that so many Badgers would ever be picked in a player pool? Shit and he has two players on MSU (Appling and Gary Harris -- Harris can fucking shoot. I like that pick). So a lot of duos here. I also love the Caris Levert pick. Have you guys seen this guy play? 6'7'', looks like he's 15 years old. Shoots 40% from three. Slashes all over. Michigan has a tough road but he scores a lot in big games. He doesn't disappear... I like James's team more than on first glance.</p>
            <h3>JOSH</h3>
            <p>I won't lie, I really hope Josh doesn't win this year. He's got a good team but as he admitted Syracuse (CJ Fair and Cooney) and Louisville (Russ Smith and Luke Hancock) are key. Russ Smith was tourney's leading scorer last year and Hancock was the Final Four MOP. So you know they can perform in crunch time. Plus they won't be wearing those fucking zoobaz pants that they wore collecting the national title. I think Ethan Wragge is going to be a bust with the last pick. You heard it here first.</p>
            <h3>ADAM</h3>
            <p>Now here is some star power. Jabari Parker to lead off. Aaron Gordon to follow. I like it. Plus he has some great names. JayVaughn Pinkston. Tekele Cotton. And Shabazz Napier. Kudos to all those moms out there.</p>
            <h3>ALEX</h3>
            <p>Not sure what to say about Katz's team here. Wilbekin was SEC player of the year. And I'm being called to do some fucking work. Bullshit.</p>
            <p>Good luck.</p>
