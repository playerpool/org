        <p>Sprinkled throughout the fossil record are the bones of innovators. With names like Lao-Tze, Newton, Carrot Top, these trailblazers arise to chart bold new courses for mankind, often to their own detriment. In 2013, one such free thinker stepped forward and, with just five short e-mails, forever changed how the world talks, writes, and thinks about Player Pool.</p>
        
        <p>His name is Dr. James Malatack, but to his brother Patrick he is simply Lil' Jim.</p>
        
        <p>Obscured within a whiteout winter of the central plains, an unheralded, virtually unknown basketball program from Bloomington was quietly kindling a resume that, by Selection Sunday, would be scorching hot. Under the calm, virtually motionless leadership of Tom Crean, the Indiana Hoosiers claimed the coveted Big Ten title for what was undoubtedly the first time in school history. Although written off by experts and cranks alike, this dominance did not go unnoticed by the keen eye of Dr. Malatack. When the Player Pool draft dust settled, James had a squad containing five of IU's brightest stars, by far the most lopsided roster ever assembled. (Ed. note: the highest scoring 2013 Player Pool Hoosier wasn't among them. That honor went to Alex's #1, Victor Oladipo.)</p>
        
        <p>Just how unusual was this commitment to a single school? Let's get down to business. Instead of tallying players from the same team, let's first cast a larger net and focus on players selected from within the same region. As a metric of Player Pool roster balance, I've turned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a>. Here, this is the number of picks that need to be changed in order to achieve a perfect 2-2-2-2 balance across the four tournament regions. In the chart below, I have scaled point totals by the median total of each year. Champions are marked in blue.</p>

        <p>It's clear from this chart that player balance across regions doesn't significantly affect your total points, and the ANOVA backs this up. But what happens when your unbalance comes from players on the same team? Can a champion arise when points must be shared amongst players? I surveyed the spreadsheet for squads with and without teammates. </p>
        
        <img src="images/statshack3.jpg" alt="Teammates" style="width:600px;height:393px;">
        
        <p>Perhaps surprisingly, more than half of your teams included teammates. Nevertheless, no significant difference in scaled point totals was observed. Furthermore, championship squads are no more or less likely to include teammates (Chi<sup>2</sup>, p=.83).</p>
        
        <p>And yet, a feeling persists there is some upper threshold of points which 'the Malatack Stack' simply cannot exceed. More on the limits of Player Pool scoring in Part II. For now, I depart with a tip of the cap to James. Three years after posting the lowest Player Pool total ever thanks to IU, he drafted three Sooners and two Villanova Wildcats en route to the 2016 title. Carrot can't top that.</p>
