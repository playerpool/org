        <h2>Part II: Shallow diving the Malatack Stack</h2>

        <p>My fascination with maximization borders on compulsion. Par exemple, despite NBA salaries totaling $292,198,327 I’ll endorse <a href="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/06/20/USAT/0c3ad628-b882-47e8-be5d-1428441c2421-GettyImages-225338.jpg?width=600&height=930&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp" target="_blank">anything</a>. Seriously, <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cskCKa3S8y0/sddefault.jpg#404_is_fine" target="_blank">ANYTHING</a>. So when Patrick clandestinely requested my help formulating an actual Player Pool draft strategy and his check cleared, I fired up the GPUs to break down his better half’s groundbreaking Stack.</p>
        
        <p>For our purposes here, we’ll focus on what’s theoretically possible, i.e. the maximums. Reports on sample distributions may be had with a healthy deposit to my coffer.</p>
        
        <p>Back in 2013, five Indiana Hoosiers failed to capture the championship for James. Instead, they left him with the worst Player Pool score in history (ed. note: surpassed by Rob in 2021). But it didn’t need to go that way. As we saw in Part I, squads with teammates don’t score fewer points and are just as likely to produce a champion.</p>
        
        <p>What would happen if someone went full Malatack Stack? Can eight dudes dunk and defend together on their way to glory? To address this, I delved into five years (‘15-’19) of individual tournament scoring. In 2019, the runner-up Texas Tech Red Raiders (racist?) had eight players score a total of 426 points (champion UVa: 415), well short of Josh’s winning 459. But the full Stack can triumph:</p>
        
        <table>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Year</th>
                    <th>Champ</th>
                    <th>Full Stack</th>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td id="centered">2015</td>
                    <td><strong>472</strong></td>
                    <td>456</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td id="centered">2016</td>
                    <td>446</td>
                    <td><strong>500</strong></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td id="centered">2017</td>
                    <td>468</td>
                    <td><strong>474</strong></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td id="centered">2018</td>
                    <td>443</td>
                    <td><strong>499</strong></td>
                  </tr>
                    <tr>
                    <td id="centered">2015</td>
                    <td><strong>459</strong></td>
                    <td>426</td>
                  </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>Full Stack is clearly not the best draft strategy every year. What about half Stack, or even quarter Stack? The chart below plots the best possible scores when drafting from the indicated number of teams, as well as the top eight scorers regardless of affiliation.</p>

        <p>Takeaway for Patrick: avoid the Full Stack, but otherwise go nuts. Team success will drive Player Pool success.</p>
