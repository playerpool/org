            <h3>A special message from the office of the Comptroller</h3>
            <p>March 12, 2020, 11:10 AM EST</p>
            <p>Dear Player Pool Participants,</p>
            
            <p>In light of the growing public-health concern about coronavirus (COVID-19), the office of the Comptroller would like to share an update with you about our continuing actions and decisions in the face of this ever-changing, fluid situation.</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday evening, Dr. Zahm and I held a lengthy teleconference with Mark Emmert, President of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which was both informative and productive. Mark reassured us that the NCAA is taking this threat very seriously and, as always, has the best interests of the student-athletes in mind. This conversation coming after Adam Silver's decision to suspend the NBA season, Mark did admit that nothing is off the table right now -- including the complete cancellation of the NCAA Tournament. After impressing upon Mark the seriousness of this matter for the Player Pool, we came away reassured that we would be among the first to know if such a decision is made.</p>
            
            <p>As a world-renowned statistician, epidemiologist, molecular biologist, researcher, scientist and citizen of the world, Dr. Zahm has made the bold decision to travel into the heart of the outbreak in Northern Italy where he is now currently working on finding a cure. We wish him the best and cannot say enough how proud we are of him.</p>
            
            <p>As of now, we are planning to run the Player Pool just as in previous years with a draft order video to come this Selection Sunday after the brackets are announced and a full feature preview article to arrive in your inboxes on the evening of Wednesday the 18th of March. Dr. Zahm also has a couple surprises in store for you that he was been working on diligently for the last calendar year. I know you'll be as excited about these as I am.</p>
            
            <p>After very careful consideration and in support of our community, public health, wellness, as well as our wives, girlfriends and children, The Player Pool has made the difficult decision to cancel Player Pool Trip #2 to Tampa the weekend of March 20-22. The Player Pool is not taking this action in response to any known or suspected cases of COVID-19 in our community but we are seeing both public and private organizations and universities respond to COVID-19 in a variety of ways, and at the core of the responses is the notion of “social distancing” — techniques used to slow the spread of a virus or disease.</p>
            
            <p>We are proud to have made this decision even before the NBA and NCAA turned to such drastic measures of emptying stadiums and suspending seasons. As the news cycle is moving so quickly, I urge each of you to remind your significant others of the proactive stance the Player Pool has taken from day one. We do regret to inform you that the Player Pool cannot provide travel reimbursement at this time. Please contact your travel provider's website for such queries.</p>
            
            <p>If you have any further questions or concerns please reach out to me directly or reply-all to this email. While these events are certainly concerning, I am confident the Player Pool will rise to this historic occasion and provide a show for the ages in the coming weeks. On a positive note, this could make for a fascinating (albeit small sample size) case-study in the effect of crowds on upsets.</p>
            
            <p>In health,</p>
            
            <p>The Comptroller</p>
